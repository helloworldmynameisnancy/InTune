# InTune
An iOS app that provides a minimal, personalized selection of news articles each day based on user-defined preferences, to reduce anxiety, doomscrolling, and information fatigue.

## API Setup

This app uses [NewsAPI.ai](http://newsapi.ai) to fetch news articles.

1. Get a free API key at [newsapi.ai/register](https://newsapi.ai/register)
2. Copy `APIKeys.swift.example` to an `APIKeys.swift` file
3. Replace `"PUT KEY HERE"` with your actual API key

**Note:** `APIKeys.swift` is gitignored to protect the API key.

TAs can reach out to either Nancy Luu or Diana Nguyen for the API key.
